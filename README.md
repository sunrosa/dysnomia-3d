# What is this?
This is a (right now) one-quarter-baked Aurora-4x-inspired interplanetary combat sandbox. Dysnomia-3d is a temporary name.

# Design fixtures
- Being as realistic as possible
- Maximum simulation depth possible while retaining sane turn-increment times
- N-body astrodynamics
- 3-dimensional
- Detailed subsystem design for ships
- (Hopefully) realistic armor and shell/warhead impact simulations

Most of my projects never really ever go anywhere. But I've been working on this in my head for about a year, with no signs of becoming satisfied to leave it as pure speculative thought. So maybe this one will finally happen.
